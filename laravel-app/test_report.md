2. Add more edge case tests for validation rules
3. Implement API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
4. Add performance tests for endpoints that return large datasets
5. Consider adding browser tests for the frontend

## Next Steps
1. Implement user authentication endpoints
2. Add role-based access control tests
3. Create booking functionality tests
4. Add image upload tests
5. Implement search functionality with more advanced criteria

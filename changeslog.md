### Backend Seeder & Frontend Orders Integration

#### Architecture Summary
- **Backend (Laravel API)**: Orders seeding via `OrderSeeder` with realistic buyers, sellers, statuses, and product data.
- **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**: Orders dashboard fetches live seeded data from the backend API, not mock data.
- **Data Flow**: Orders are seeded in the database and fetched by `/dashboard/orders` for real end-to-end testing.

#### Model and Version Used
- Cascade agentic AI (2025-06-02)

#### User-Approved Logic Steps
- Confirmed `OrderSeeder` is registered and seeded 20+ orders.
- Ran `php artisan db:seed` to populate the backend with test orders.
- Updated frontend config to use API data (`USE_MOCK_DATA = false`).
- Ensured `/dashboard/orders` displays real seeded orders from the backend.

## 2025-06-03 - Orders Dashboard Route Activation
- Replaced the /dashboard/orders route placeholder with the actual OrdersPage component in DashboardRoutes.tsx.
- OrdersPage now fetches and displays seeded orders from the backend for end-to-end testing.
- Architecture: React (shadcn/ui) frontend, Laravel backend, REST API, service-based data flow.
- Model: OrdersPage, orderService, Laravel OrderSeeder.
- Feature flag: USE_MOCK_DATA=false, dashboard route points to OrdersPage.

## 2025-06-03 - Orders Actions API Endpoints Enabled
- Added custom endpoints for order actions (approve, deliver, cancel) in Laravel API routes (api.php).
- Registered PUT /orders/{id}/approve, /deliver, /cancel mapped to OrderController methods.
- Cleared route, config, and application cache to apply changes.
- Frontend order actions (approve, deliver, cancel) should now work end-to-end.
- Architecture: Laravel backend with RESTful + custom action routes, React (shadcn/ui) frontend.

## 2025-06-03 - Orders API Pagination Format Fix
- Fixed the backend orders API (OrderController@index) to return paginated data in the format `{ data, meta, links }` (with `meta.last_page`, etc.), matching the frontend's expectations.
- This resolves the `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'last_page')` error in the Orders dashboard.
- Cleared route, config, and application cache to apply changes.
- Architecture: Laravel backend REST API, React (shadcn/ui) frontend.
